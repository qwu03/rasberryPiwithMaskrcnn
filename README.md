# RasberryPiwithMaskrcnn
# For check maskrcnn with hand made dataset, run test.py and it will not work since there is a .h5 file missing in the github(the reason is it is too large, larger than 200MB), you can email me and put it into the logs file. Then it will work!
# For check grasping results by arm which controlled by rasberryPi, run armgetresults_maskrcnn.py
